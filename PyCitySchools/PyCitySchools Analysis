The data suggests that charter school performance is better than district schools'. The top 5 performing schools are all charter, whereas the bottom 5 performing are all district schools. 

One would think that the difference in performance would be partly due to differences in spending budget. However, the data suggests that the charter schools outperform the district even with less "Per Student Budget". 

Charter schools have smaller class sizes compared to district schools. It has been thought that smaller class size means more focused attention on the students in each class, thus better performance. The data suggests that the difference in class size does have an effect on performance. The larger the class size the less percentage of students passing.
